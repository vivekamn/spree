h1. Rails CKEditor integration plugin with SWFUpload support

CKEditor is a text editor to be used inside web pages. It's a WYSIWYG editor, which means that the text being edited on it looks as similar as possible to 
the results users have when publishing it. It brings to the web common editing features found on desktop editing applications like Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.

Because CKEditor is licensed under flexible Open Source and commercial licenses, you'll be able to integrate and use it inside any kind of application. 
This is the ideal editor for developers, created to provide easy and powerful solutions to their users.

Last rake generated file config/ckeditor.yml:
<pre><code>
development: 
  swf_file_post_name: "data"
  
  swf_image_file_types_description: "Images"
  swf_image_file_types: "*.jpg;*.jpeg;*.png;*.gif"
  swf_image_file_size_limit: "5 MB"
  swf_image_file_upload_limit: 10
  
  swf_types_description: "Files"

  file_manager_image_upload_uri: "/ckeditor/create?kind=image"
  file_manager_image_uri: "/ckeditor/images"
</code></pre>

Check the file "rails-ckeditor/app/controllers/ckeditor_controller.rb", it used objects "Picture" and "AttachmentFile" 
to preserve images and files, respectively. So, in folder "rails-ckeditor/examples" are examples of these objects for the paperclip and attachment_fu.
You can correct this controller for your needs, or copy the necessary files in yours project folder "app/models", and do not forget about migration.

h2. Usage

Basically include this in the page you wish to use the editor in
<pre><code>
  <%= javascript_include_tag :ckeditor %>
</code></pre>

Then instead of the normal textarea helper from Rails use this one
<pre><code>
  <%= ckeditor_textarea("object", "field", :width => '100%', :height => '200px') %>
</code></pre>

FormBuilder helper for more usefully 

<pre><code>  
  <% form_for :page, :url => pages_path do |form| -%>
    ...
    <%= form.cktext_area :content, :toolbar=>'Full', :swf_params=>{:assetable_type=>'User', :assetable_id=>current_user.id} %>
    ...
  <% end -%>
</code></pre>
  
h3. Support options
<pre><code> 
  :cols    # Textarea cols
  :rows    # Textarea rows
  :width   # Editor width
  :height  # Editor height
  :class   # Textarea css class name
  :toolbar # Toolbar name
  :skin    # Editor skin
  :language # Editor language
  :swf_params # SWFUpload additional params
</code></pre>

Check "public/javascripts/ckcustom.js" for config options.
Modify "public/javascripts/ckcustom/contents.css" - this stylesheet use editor

h3. AJAX

To use a remote form you need to do something like this
<pre><code>
  <%= form_remote_tag :url => @options.merge(:controller => @scaffold_controller),
                    :before => Ckeditor_before_js('note', 'text') %>

    <%= ckeditor_textarea( "note", "text", :ajax => true ) %>

  <%= end_form_tag %>
</code></pre>

If you forget to put in the :before it won't work, you can also use the Ckeditor_form_remote_tag described below

h3. Multiple Editors in a form

To create a form using multiple editors use the Ckeditor_form_remote_tag helper and pass the :editors option. This takes an hash of model symbol keys with each having
an array as its value. The array should contain the list of fields that will have editors attached to them.
<pre><code>
  <%= ckeditor_form_remote_tag :url => @options.merge(:controller => @scaffold_controller),
                              :editors => { :multinote => ['text1', 'text2'] } %>

    <%= ckeditor_textarea( "multinote", "text1", :ajax => true ) %>
    <%= ckeditor_textarea( "multinote", "text2", :ajax => true ) %>

  <%= end_form_tag %>
</code></pre>
